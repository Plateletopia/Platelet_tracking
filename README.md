# Platelet_tracking
Code to describe and quantify platelet behaviour during thrombus formation

This project aims to create new ways to analyse platelet behaviour during thrombus formation in vivo. The images used are 4D time lapses of fractionally labelled platelets acquired on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope after laser-induced injury to the blood vessel wall in mice.
